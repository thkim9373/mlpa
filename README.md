# DeepFace
a deep face analysis implement, mainly based on -[Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe). At this time, face analysis tasks like detection, alignment and recognition have been done. -[中文Readme](https://github.com/RiweiChen/DeepFace/blob/master/README_ch.md)

Each task is divide by different folder.

##Face detection

###baseline
Face detection using sliding windows style, it first train a face/noface two class classification network, and then tranform to a full convolution network, detection is based on the heatmap when input a large full size image.

face detection result example：
![result1](FaceDetection/result/1.jpeg)
![result2](FaceDetection/result/2.jpeg)

  
##Face key points detection

###try1_1
face 5 key points detection using DeepID architecture.

##Face Verification
###deepid
Face verification based on DeepID network architecture.

face verification ROC result：

##Face Dataset

We collect the face datasets usually used by recently years' paper, and divide by different task. Also we  simply describe each of the dataset.(In Chinese)
